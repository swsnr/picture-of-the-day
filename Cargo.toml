# Our version number.  Since semver doesn't make much sense for UI applications
# which have no API we repurpose the version numer as follows:
#
# - major: Major new features or major changes to the UI, which may break the app for some users.
# - minor: User-visible features or bugfixes.
# - patch: Translation updates.
#
# Major and minor releases get release notes, but patch releases do not; this
# enables us to ship updates to translations whenever translators contributed
# new languages or made major updates, while still providing meaningful release
# notes for the last functional changes.
